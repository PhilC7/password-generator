# password-generator

For this exercise I had to create a random password generator.

- When the button is clicked it would generate a password.

- I had to present a series of prompts for the following:
  - Length of password (Between 8-128 characters long).
  - Give a choice of character types (Lowercase, Uppercase, Numeric and Special characters ($@\*%&\, etc)).
  - The code should validate for each input, making sure at least 1 character type is selected.
  - After all prompts have been answered then the password can be created.
  - This will then input the password into the textbox on screen.

# Useage

The website can be accessed [here](https://philc7.github.io/password-generator/)

To view the results you have to:

- Open the link up in the browser.
- Click on **_Generate Password_** button.
- Input your selected password length in the prompt box shown.
- Select **_OK_** to at least 1 of the options for character types.
- After all prompts, your password should appear on the screen

### This is how the page should look.
